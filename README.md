## **Project Overview**  
The objective of this project is to analyze global data science salaries and determine how various factors such as region, company size, remote work opportunities, and experience level impact compensation. Visualization techniques and statistical analysis were used to uncover trends and insights in the salary distribution.

## **Datasets**  
- **Data Science Salary Dataset**: Includes salary data from different countries, company sizes, work experience levels, and remote work ratios.

## **Methodology**  
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Removed null values and standardized categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized salary trends across different categories.
3. **Feature Analysis**: Investigated the impact of factors such as region, company size, and experience on salaries.
4. **Visualization**: Used pie charts and bar plots to present the distribution of salaries across various features.

## **Results and Insights**  
- **Remote Work**: A significant portion of data science professionals work fully remotely, which impacts salary expectations.
- **Experience Level**: Higher experience levels naturally lead to higher salaries, with notable jumps at senior positions.
- **Region**: Salaries vary significantly across different regions, with the highest in North America and Europe.
  
## **Technologies Used**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
